"""Robust parser for Gemini viral-moment JSON responses.

Implements a 5-level fallback chain designed to make the clip-detection
pipeline resilient to the kinds of malformations Gemini occasionally
produces (stray backslashes, smart quotes, code fences, reasoning
prose mixed with the JSON body, trailing commas, etc.):

    1. strict   - json.loads on the section after the ``### JSON ###``
                  delimiter (or on the full text if absent).
    2. clean    - deterministic cleanup pass (smart quotes, trailing
                  commas, lone backslashes, control chars) then retry.
    3. json_repair - delegate to the ``json_repair`` library if
                  installed.
    4. retry    - one additional round-trip to Gemini with the decoder
                  error as context, asking it to emit JSON only.
    5. fallback - give up, return ``ParseResult.data = None`` so the
                  caller can degrade gracefully (whole-video mode).

Post-parse, ``validate_and_dedupe`` runs the result through the
``ViralClipsResponse`` Pydantic model and removes clips whose time
ranges overlap more than ``overlap_threshold`` (IoU) with a
higher-scoring neighbour.
