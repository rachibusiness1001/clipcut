"""Pure lexical TextTiling — dependency-light topic segmentation of a transcript.

The boundary math (gap-score → smoothing → depth-score → boundary identification)
is ported faithfully from ``ClipsAI/clipsai`` (`clip/texttiler.py`), but the
neural sentence-embedding front-end is swapped for the **classic Hearst (1997)
lexical block comparison**: term-frequency vectors over windows of transcript
segments, compared by cosine similarity. That swap is the whole point — it needs
NO ``sentence-transformers`` / ``torch`` model download (a ~90 MB dep ClippyMe
otherwise avoids), only the transcript text the pipeline already has.

Used as a smarter **whole-video fallback**: when Gemini viral detection is
unavailable (no key) or fails (parse/network), instead of rendering the entire
source as one giant vertical clip we segment the transcript into topic-coherent
chunks and emit several reasonably-sized clips. It is *not* viral-ranked — it has
no AI judgment — but topic-coherent multi-clip output beats a single whole-video
dump for the no-API-key / API-down path.

Pure stdlib + numpy → host-importable and host-unit-tested (no cv2/torch import),
following the established ``reframe_ops.py`` / ``media_probe.py`` pattern (testable
math in its own module, thin glue in ``main.py``). See
``docs/clipsai-analysis.md`` for the comparison and rationale.
